Welcome to Bubbling Library 2.x.

Javascript Bubbling Library is a set of components, behaviors and widgets, 
for building event-driven web applications using the bubble-up technique. 
The Bubbling Library also includes several plugins that can be used to 
extend the YUI Library to manage dynamic areas which are closely related 
with the event-driven philosophy. All components in the Bubbling Library 
have been released as open source under a BSD license and are free for 
all uses.

The YUI Library is a set of utilities and controls, written in JavaScript,
for building richly interactive web applications using techniques such 
as DOM scripting, DHTML and AJAX. YUI is available under a BSD license 
and is free for all uses.

Code found in the development head is always a work in progress and
should be treated as experimental.
